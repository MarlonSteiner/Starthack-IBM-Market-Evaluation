        "article_text": "With Vermont’s prisons reaching capacities they haven’t hit since the onset of Covid-19, Vermont Department of Corrections officials are grappling with how to handle the influx of people incarcerated. The state now incarcerates more women than it has beds at its lone women’s prison. In some facilities, people are sleeping on temporary plastic “sled beds” on cell floors. The growing population means prison officials are now considering sending more people to a private prison in Mississippi. In just two years, Vermont’s prison population has risen by almost 300, from 1,366 in September 2023 to more than 1,650 today. To be sure, the level is below the roughly 1,750 seen in 2019 and a peak of more than 2,200 in the late 2000s. State data shows the detainee population — people jailed while awaiting trial — is rising more rapidly than the sentenced population. At the same time, Vermont’s prisons have experienced persistent staffing shortages. This week,WCAX reportedon a lack of officers at Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport leading to continued mandatory overtime for staff. That facility’s vacancy rate for officers and shift supervisors is 28%, while the state’s five other facilities have vacancy rates between 10% and 20%, according to department data. According to Joshua Rutherford, the department’s facilities division deputy director, the state always expected the prison population to rise. “Starting this spring, that has accelerated, and we started to fill up faster than we had anticipated,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Nobody calls me to ask how many beds I have before they impose a sentence.” Plans to reopen three units in three different prisons this month should help ease the problem, Rutherford said. Those units had been shuttered during Covid due to staffing shortages and a decreased population. But with some people forced to sleep on temporary floor beds, and the state’s only women’s prison now over capacity, the situation requires immediate action and creative thinking. Corrections leaders, lawmakers and Vermont’s chief superior court judge have all suggested a combination of factors contributing to the spike. Pandemic-era policies meant fewer police interactions and some people released from prison — initiatives that have since ended. Some crimes, both violent and nonviolent, have increased. Public and political demands for more accountability have increased, too, as concerns aboutcrime in downtowns — particularly in Burlington— have grown. The Vermont Legislature has alsocreated new and stricter crimes. In July 2024, Vermont’s bail laws changed, allowing judges to increase the amount of bail for defendants who were accused of crimes while out on release in other cases. Chief Superior Court Judge Thomas Zonay told lawmakers last week that that change may be increasing the number of detainees. He compared recent bail data to that from May 2024. Over that time, the number of people held on less than $10,000 bail increased by more than 60%, or about 50 people. A similar increase wasn’t seen in other bail amounts that were unlikely to be impacted by the recent legislation. About 40 more people are held without bail now than were in May 2024, a number that reflects people held for serious felony charges. The confluence of changes means that for the first time in years, Vermont’s prisons are overfull or close to it. Data from this week showed all of Vermont’s six prisons had at least one general population unit at or over capacity. At the women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, 180 women were squeezed into a facility with only 118 general population beds and 164 currently operating beds. The 183 women incarcerated across Vermont as of Thursday is also more than the 158-bed plan previouslyproposed for a replacement women’s prison and reentry facility. A similar pattern appears across the system. Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland, Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town and Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield all have general population units detaining more people than the number of available beds, according to Department of Corrections data. For Rutherford, the corrections official focused on population, the spike in people incarcerated is forcing him and colleagues to come up with less-than-ideal solutions. In the past, the state utilized prisons’ gymnasium space for extra beds. The department is already utilizing temporary plastic beds on the floor of cells. When the state’s prisons reach capacity, Vermont sends people out of state. Through the state’s contract with CoreCivic, one of the country’s largest private prison companies, Vermont sends just under 130 men to Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi — about half of 2019’s out-of-state population. The CoreCivic contract currently allows Vermont to utilize up to 300 beds, but only for men — meaning overcrowding at the South Burlington women’s prison poses a trickier problem at the moment. “Increased reliance on out-of-state (prisons) is absolutely a possibility,” Rutherford said, specifically referencing the male population. Tim Burgess, an advocate for incarcerated people in Vermont, experienced overcrowding himself while in prison in the state in the 2000s. At the time, the Department of Corrections was utilizing sled beds. “Picture a red sled like you use to go sledding. It’s a little longer, it looks a little like a narrow canoe. If you’re a larger person, it is about as comfortable as you’d think it would be,” he said. In a tight two-man cell, furnished with a bunk bed, a desk and toilet, the person in the sled bed typically finds themself wedged somewhere near the toilet. “It’s ugly,” Burgess said. Matt Valerio, Vermont’s defender general, said sled beds are a sanitary issue. He said recent instances of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria MRSA at the Rutland prison, where the temporary beds have been utilized, has caused concern. (A department spokesperson said there were a “small number” of MRSA cases system wide this summer, declining to provide specifics due to medical privacy concerns.) After 25 years on the job, Valerio is familiar with the era when Vermont incarcerated far more people and sent hundreds more out of state. “The biggest issue I see right now is we have a massive detention population,” he said. The more than 650 people currently detained while awaiting trial is two or three times higher than in the past, according to Valerio. The overall upward trend in incarceration, Valerio argued, could be traced in part to political and public pressure in response to concerns about public safety. That pressure can swing the pendulum in instances where there’s discretion — judges issuing bail, the Department of Corrections releasing people on furlough and the parole board approving parole, he said. To Valerio, it was a “no brainer” that the state’s prison population would rise from pandemic lows. “The real question is how high is it going to go. And what’s going to happen — where are we going to put them?”"

        "title": "Vermont Department of Health issues broad guidance on vaccines for respiratory viruses and extends pharmacy access for Covid-19 booster",
        "url": "https://vtdigger.org/2025/09/18/department-of-health-extends-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-for-vermonters-five-and-up/",
        "article_text": "The Vermont Department of Health issued its vaccinerecommendationson respiratory viruses Thursday andauthorizedVermont pharmacies to give anyone age five and over access to a Covid-19 booster shot through a standing order. “The recommendations are the most important thing so that it is clear for Vermonters and for providers what the health department position is on the COVID-19 vaccine,” interim Health Commissioner Julie Arel said in an interview with VTDigger. “The standing order is a tool to try to help support pharmacists to be able to administer the vaccine.” Both the recommendations and the standing order follow the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, according to the department guidance. The Vermont Health Department recommends that anyone 6 months old and above get the Covid-19 vaccine. “We think anybody who wants a vaccine should be able to get one, but there are certain populations that we think it’s even more important to have them get the vaccine,” Arel said. Babies between 6 to 24 months see higher rates of hospitalization from Covid-19 and should get vaccinated to prevent the risk of severe illness, Arel added. Vaccination is also particularly important for pregnant people, who can confer immunity in utero; it serves as critical protection for babies before they are old enough to receive a vaccine. The department’s recommendations also underscore the importance for people 65 years old or older and individuals with existing health conditions to get the shots. The Health Department releases vaccine recommendations every year — which includes guidance on RSV and flu vaccination as well. This year, however, the recommendations served to provide added clarity against a backdrop of confusion surrounding the federal guidelines and approvals on vaccinations. The state’s recommendations come on the same day that aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention panel beganto discuss and vote on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. Many state public health officials have watched closely to see what the panel may suggest, after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stacked the panel with vaccine skeptics. In August, the Food and Drug Administration authorized updated Covid-19 vaccines for this upcoming cold and flu season with the guidance that they should be administered to those 65 and above or with existing health risks. That does not prevent doctors from offering an “off-label” prescription, which a health care provider can give outside the scope of FDA approval. Vermont’s standing order gives pharmacies room to administer the updated Covid-19 vaccines without having the patient attest to a prior health risk. The order strives to make it as easy as possible for pharmacies to issue the vaccines this way, Arel said. “[Off-lable use] is a pretty accepted practice, but it’s a little bit different for pharmacists, and so this is just a way to try to help smooth the path for them to be able to get those vaccines out to more people.” Right now, pharmacies are the only sites in the state that have this season’s Covid-19 vaccines. Doctors’ offices and other clinics, which often get vaccines from the CDC via the state, have not been able to order the vaccines from the federal government. Pharmacies, on the other hand, order vaccines directly from the manufacturer, and thus they have been able to move forward with administering the vaccine. However, Vermontstate law preventspharmacies from administering vaccines to children under five years old, meaning that this population will have to wait until the vaccines land in their pediatricians’ offices. “I know it’s frustrating for parents to not be able to get the vaccine yet for their children,” said Arel. “We have to wait for the CDC to make it available for us to order through the usual pathways.” She anticipates that the vaccines will arrive in Vermont by early to mid- October. On Thursday, a group of Northeastern states alsoformalizedits coalition to collaborate on public health guidance, as the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. Vermont state health officialsattended preliminary meetings of the collaborativebut issued its recommendations on respiratory illness independently from the coalition today —despite publicizing the recommendations on the same dayas the block of Northeastern states. Both of the state’s private insurers — Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT and MVP — confirmed to VTDigger earlier in September that they intend to continue covering COVID-19 vaccines at no cost and with no prior approval. The health department’s recommendations confirm that Medicaid will continue to cover the cost of the shots, and since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65 or with existing health risks, Medicare, which covers the same age group, should also cover the vaccines. The only unknown, Arel said, are employer-sponsored insurance plans, which are federally regulated. “It really behooves folks to cover the vaccine,” she said. “It helps to prevent the most severe forms of the disease.” “Getting vaccinated is the best way for us to protect ourselves and others, especially as we head into the fall season,” Governor Phil Scott said in apress releasehis office issued highlighting the order. “This order is a necessary step to make sure those who want a vaccine, can get one.” The order is effective until August 31, 2026, unless rescinded earlier."

        "url": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/rio-de-janeiro-news-roundup-comprehensive-city-brief-for-september-18-2025/",
        "article_text": "A dramatic security incident gripped Rio de Janeiro on September 18, 2025, as armed militiamen stormed a hospital, sparking political fallout and swift police action. City officials pressed for stronger safety measures amid rising crime concerns, from spiking cargo thefts to violent fan groups. Meanwhile, Rio celebrated progress in healthcare and innovation: a major tech event brought investment, a long-closed hospital ward reopened, and cancer patients saw restored services. Cultural life marched on with the cast reveal of a new samba musical, even as daily life was punctuated by ongoing challenges in public safety and infrastructure. Militiamen Storm Hospital in Santa Cruz, Targeting Patient in Vain– In the early hours of the day, a group of eight masked militiamen armed with rifles invaded Hospital Municipal Pedro II in Santa Cruz. Disguised as police officers, they sought a patient – a gang member injured in a prior shootout – intending to execute him. The heavily armed intruders reached the surgical center but failed to find their target, who had been secretly moved to another ward under protection. No staff or patients were harmed during the brazen incursion, and the targeted patient was later transferred safely to a different hospital under police escort. Why it matters:This unprecedented attack on a healthcare facility underscores the extreme boldness of Rio’s militia groups and the peril they pose to public safety. Invading a hospital – traditionally a neutral sanctuary – marks an alarming escalation in criminal tactics. The incident left hundreds of patients and medical staff terrorized and highlights the urgent need for stronger security measures at public institutions in areas plagued by organized crime. City Leaders Demand Police Protection in Hospitals After Attack– In the wake of the Pedro II invasion, Mayor Eduardo Paes and his administration publicly blasted the security lapse and pressed state authorities for immediate action. Rio’s Municipal Health Secretary described the atmosphere during the assault as “extremely critical,” noting that maternity patients, children, and over 300 inpatients were at risk amid the chaos. City officials insist that municipal hospital guards are not equipped to repel armed gangs and called on Governor Cláudio Castro’s government to station police units at major hospitals around the clock. Castro’s representatives initially defended state efforts, leading to tense exchanges between city and state secretaries on social media over who bears responsibility. Why it matters:The armed incursion ignited a political showdown betweenRio’s city hall and state government, exposing strains in their cooperation on public security. The mayor’s urgent pleas for permanent police presence in hospitals reflect mounting anxiety over violence spilling into civic spaces. How state authorities respond will test their commitment to protecting vulnerable sites and could set new protocols for safeguarding Rio’s health network against organized crime. Report Shows Cargo Thefts Soaring Across Rio– New crime statistics released on the 18th revealed a sharp rise in cargo robberies in Rio de Janeiro state from January through August 2025. The Public Security Institute’s data highlighted that freight theft incidents – targeting trucks carrying goods – increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Highways and access roads in the capital and Baixada Fluminense have been especially affected, with criminal gangs hijacking shipments of electronics, food, and other commodities. Authorities noted that many of these thefts are linked to militia and drug factions financing their activities through black-market resale. Why it matters:Surging cargo thefts threaten Rio’s economy and everyday life, driving up consumer prices and endangering truck drivers. The spike underscores persistent law enforcement challenges in securing transit routes and combating well-organized theft rings. It also damages Rio’s business climate, as logistics and delivery companies face higher risks and costs. The alarming trend puts pressure on state security forces to intensify highway patrols and intelligence efforts to protect commerce and hold criminal groups accountable. Police Raid Cracks Down on Violent Football Fan Gangs– In a citywide operation code-named “Pax Stadium,” Rio’s Civil Police executed 39 search warrants targeting members of organized futebol fan clubs involved in criminal acts. Officers swept locations linked to radical fan factions early on the 18th, arresting two suspects and fatally wounding one alleged ringleader in an armed confrontation. The raid, coordinated with a special sports tribunal, aimed to seize weapons and evidence related to recent violent clashes among rival torcida groups. It followed a high-profile brawl that left two fans dead last month. Along with arrests, police confiscated club documents and digital files suspected to contain coded messages coordinating fights. Why it matters:Football passion in Rio is often marred by extremist fan violence, and this operation signals a firm stance against hooliganism. By targeting criminal elements within organized fan clubs, authorities seek to prevent riots and even gang-like activity tied to sports. The crackdown sends a warning that stadium-related violence won’t be tolerated, especially as Rio hosts major matches. It also reflects broader efforts to ensure public safety in large events and to separate true sports fandom from those using club rivalries as cover for crime. Officers Suspended After Shooting of App Driver– Three Military Police officers who opened fire on a ride-share driver’s car in a mistaken-identity incident have been relieved from street duty, officials announced. The plainclothes officers had fired multiple shots at the driver in northern Rio, apparently suspecting criminal activity, but the unarmed man was an innocent app-based taxi driver. He survived with injuries. Initially, the police command kept the officers on active patrol, claiming no court order mandated suspension. However, after public outrage and viral video of the aftermath, the commanders reversed course and pulled the officers from operational assignments pending an investigation. Why it matters:The incident raised serious concerns about police use of force and accountability in Rio. Only after media attention and community pressure did the military police act, highlighting the role of public scrutiny in curbing potential abuses. For residents, the quick resort to gunfire by officers is alarming in a city already grappling with violence. The suspension of the policemen is seen as a step toward accountability and transparency. How this case is handled will influence public trust in law enforcement and the willingness of authorities to address misconduct within police ranks. Two Bodies Found in Suspected Gang Hit in Praça Seca– Residents of Praça Seca, in Rio’s West Zone, woke to a grim discovery: two men shot dead and left in front of a local supermarket. The victims’ bodies were found tied up in the early morning, execution-style, in an area long troubled by turf wars between militias and drug traffickers. Police believe the double homicide is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle for control of the neighborhood, which has seen frequent shootouts and summary killings. Investigators are working to identify the men and link the crime to known factions. Patrols were reinforced in Praça Seca following the incident, though no arrests have been made yet. Why it matters:The brutality of organized crime hit close to home for Praça Seca residents, underscoring that despite security operations, parts of Rio remain hostage to gang violence. Public spaces turning into dumping grounds for murder victims instill fear and drive home the message of underworld dominance. This incident highlights the continued challenge authorities face in reclaiming and pacifying communities entrenched in violent conflict. It also reinforces calls from citizens for more sustained police presence and socio-economic programs to break the cycle of gang control in Rio’s vulnerable neighborhoods. Rio Innovation Week Generates R$150 Million in Business– City officials reported that Rio Innovation Week, a major technology and startups expo held in September, delivered an economic boost of roughly R$150 million to the city. The four-day event drew thousands of entrepreneurs, investors, and tech enthusiasts to Centro, where local startups showcased products and forged deals with national and international partners. According to the city’s development agency, dozens of partnership agreements and investment commitments were signed on the conference sidelines, spanning sectors from fintech to green energy. Small businesses benefited from the influx of visitors, and hotels saw high occupancy due to the event. Why it matters:This successful Innovation Week positions Rio de Janeiro as a rising tech and innovation hub inBrazil. The sizable business generated and investments pledged can translate into new jobs, startups setting up shop in the city, and continued diversification of Rio’s economy beyond tourism and oil. The city government’s support for such events is part of a strategy to attract creative industries and bolster Rio’s image as a modern, business-friendly metropolis. The economic jolt from the event is a welcome bright spot as the city strives to recover growth and encourage entrepreneurship. Oncoclínicas Resumes Cancer Care for Unimed Rio Patients– After months of uncertainty, thousands of cancer patients in Rio regained access to treatment as the Oncoclínicas network rejoined Unimed Rio’s health coverage. Effective September 18, the prominent oncology clinics resumed accepting Unimed health insurance following a new short-term contract. The deal, initially for two months, came after regulators urged a resolution when Oncoclínicas had suspended services over reimbursement disputes. Patients had faced transfers or delays in chemotherapy and other care during the impasse. With the agreement in place, major cancer centers in the city reopened to Unimed clients, and continuity of care was restored. Why it matters:The restoration of this partnership is a relief for many families in Rio. It ensures that cancer patients who rely on Unimed health plans can once again receive specialized treatments without paying out-of-pocket or traveling far. The episode drew attention to regulatory oversight of health providers: Brazil’s national health agency (ANS) had to intervene, highlighting the need for stronger patient protections in contract disputes. Ultimately, the resumption helps stabilize Rio’s private healthcare landscape and underscores the importance of collaboration between insurers and medical networks for the well-being of patients. Renovated Andaraí Hospital Ward Reopens After Years– Rio’s Hospital do Andaraí, a long-neglected federal facility recently taken over by the city, celebrated a milestone with the reopening of its 10th-floor inpatient ward and a third-floor outpatient clinic on September 18. These sections had been closed for many years due to deterioration. The municipal government oversaw extensive renovations as part of the hospital’s transfer to city management, installing new equipment and expanding bed capacity. The reopened ward adds dozens of beds for medium-complexity care, and the clinic will provide specialty consultations that were previously unavailable in the community. Local residents and hospital staff marked the occasion as a victory for public health access. Why it matters:In a city often strained for hospital space, bringing dormant healthcare infrastructure back to life is significant. The Andaraí Hospital improvements mean more patients in Rio’s North Zone can be treated closer to home, easing pressure on other crowded hospitals. It also showcases the progress of the municipalization plan – the city taking charge of formerly federal hospitals to improve efficiency and service. The successful reopening builds confidence that management changes can translate into tangible healthcare benefits, and it offers a template for further upgrades in Rio’s public health network. Samba Musical “A Pérola Negra do Samba” Unveils Cast– A new musical celebrating Rio’s rich samba heritage took a step forward as producers revealed the cast of “A Pérola Negra do Samba”. In a press event on September 18, renowned cultural reporter Fábio Júdice introduced the lead actors and ensemble who will bring this original story to the stage. The production is inspired by the life of a pioneering samba composer (the “Black Pearl” of the title) and will feature classic samba songs alongside an original score. The cast includes veteran performers from Rio’s teatro musical scene and up-and-coming talent discovered in open auditions earlier this year. Rehearsals are underway, with opening night slated for the coming month at a prominent downtown theater. Why it matters:This musical adds to Rio de Janeiro’s vibrant cultural tapestry, paying homage to the city’s samba roots through live theater. By spotlighting a black samba icon, it also underscores efforts to celebrate Afro-Brazilian contributions to Rio’s identity. The anticipation around the show’s debut reflects a broader revival of the performing arts after pandemic-era disruptions. For the local arts community, a large-scale musical means jobs and creative opportunities, while audiences can look forward to a production that honors Rio’s musical legacy and provides an uplifting escape in challenging times."

        "url": "https://www.rappler.com/business/phinma-chair-emeritus-oscar-hilado-dies/",
        "article_text": "MANILA, Philippines – Businessman Oscar J. Hilado, a long-time executive of Filipino conglomerate PHINMA, died on Wednesday, September 17, the company disclosed to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Friday. He was 87. PHINMA also announced his demise in a social media post with a quote from Hilado that says, “We have shown the world that it can be done, and done well.” PHINMA, a pioneer in the country’s cement industry, traces its origins to post-World War 2, a time when, PHINMA says, it was”thought Filipinos were not capable of managing large corporations professionally.” But its founder, led by the late ambassador to Japan Ramon V. Del Rosario, sought to prove otherwise. Hilado was an executive assistant of Del Rosario, and rose from the ranks to head the conglomerate. It has interests in steel (Union Galvasteel Corp.) and cement (Philcement Corporation), education (PHINMA Education), housing (PHINMA Community Housing Corp.), and property development, among others. PHINMA’s mission is “to make lives better and build the nation through successfully run and profitable businesses that uphold our core values of integrity, competence, professionalism and love of country.” In an interviewpublished inBusinessWorldin February 2023, Hilado said that PHINMA’s founders established it to be a Filipino company, “and wanted to put Filipinos first.” “This was passed down to me, this kind of outlook,” he said. In 2021, speaking about the conglomerate’s 60-year history, he said: “I have been proud to witness PHINMA’s growth as we developed market leadership in multiple industries. I have likewise been proud to witness the development of generations of civic-minded managers, full of integrity and love for country, that continue to utilize their abilities to build the nation sustainably and responsibly running our business.” In line with its motto of “Making Lives Better,” PHINMA has been investing heavily in Philippine education. Its focus is on providing “accessible, quality education to underserved youth, specifically low-income high school graduates, most of whom are the first in their families to attend college,” according to PHINMA CEO Ramon del Rosario Jr., who served as finance secretary from 1992 to 1993 during the Ramos administration.

PHINMA said that through Hilado’s “stellar financial sense and business acumen,” he was able to steer the conglomerate “through challenging times and into new frontiers.” One of those challenging times was during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. “More importantly, Mr. Hilado’s unwavering commitment to making lives better has uplifted countless Filipinos and made a significant, long-lasting impact in the business community and civic society,” PHINMA said. “Mr. OJH [Hilado’s initials], thank you for showing us and the world that it can be done, and done well.

His legacy of integrity, excellence, and service will continue to inspire the entire organization.” Holding company A. Soriano Corporation or ANSCOR, in its disclosure, said Hilado’s “professionalism, wise counsel and unwavering commitment, even in the face of illness, left an indelible mark on the organization and all of us who had the privilege of working with him.” Hilado was PHINMA chairman of the board from 2003 to 2021. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Commerce from De La Salle College Bacolod, and had a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Graduate School of Business.

        "url": "https://www.rappler.com/business/ombudsman-lifts-suspension-gsis-chief-wick-veloso/",
        "article_text": "MANILA, Philippines – The Ombudsman has lifted the preventive suspension against Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) President and General Manager Wick Veloso. In a decision dated Wednesday, September 17, Acting Ombudsman Dante Vargas ordered the reinstatement of Veloso and the following officials: Former executive vice president Michael Praxedes and former vice president Aaron Chan were not included in the reinstatement since they were no longer with the state workers’ pension fund. Veloso and the six other officials were suspended without pay back in July over the GSIS’P1.45-billion investmentin renewable energy firm Alternergy Holdings. The deal was previously flagged by the Commission on Audit (COA) since it did not go through the board approval process. COA wrote that the GSIS invested P2.3 billion in three firms with no proven track record of profitability over the last three years. But Veloso insisted that the Alternergy investment was lawful since only investments worth P1.5 billion and above require the GSIS board’s nod. Under theGovernment Service Insurance System Act of 1997, the GSIS is allowed to invest in common or preferred shares of a company listed with the Philippine Stock Exchange. The company should also have a three-year record of profitability and have paid investors dividends at least once over the same period. Alternergy first went public in 2023, and in Julydeclaredits first dividend payout scheduled for September. The Ombudsman found there was insufficient ground that Veloso’s continued stay as GSIS chief would jeopardize the case. It also noted that the necessary documents or evidence were already in their possession. In a statement, Veloso welcomed the Ombudsman’s decision and said he looked forward to returning to the GSIS and continue growing the fund for all government workers. He also vowed to share more updates in due course. “As President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has consistently emphasized, GSIS must remain focused on securing the long-term financial security of public servants and their families. I am committed to that mission. Our work continues — with humility, resolve, and the quiet focus of a public servant,” he said. –Rappler.com"
